# StreamFund

## Summary

**StreamFund** is designed to enhance the relationship between content creators on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook and their audience. Unlike traditional donation tools, StreamFund provides real-time engagement, allowing viewers to send personalized messages that appear directly on the stream. By offering instant payouts, ease of setup, and seamless integration with OBS Studio, StreamFund aims to transform viewers into active supporters, creating meaningful connections and supporting streamers as they create content.

## Overview

### The Problem

Streamers face several challenges:

- **Fragmented and Platform-Restricted Donations**: Each streaming platform has its own donation system, creating issues with fund consolidation and access.
- **Limited Audience Engagement**: Existing platforms offer limited interaction, typically restricted to basic chat.
- **Complex Setup Processes**: Many solutions are challenging to set up, making them impractical for streamers seeking simplicity.

### Our Solution

- **Unified Donations**: Consolidates donations across platforms, eliminating the need to manage multiple donation accounts and enabling instant, direct payouts.
- **Real-Time Viewer Interaction**: Allows viewers to send personalized messages and questions displayed live on the stream, deepening engagement.
- **Simple Setup**: A seamless integration with OBS Studio/Streamlabs/other streaming apps through a stream key, allowing streamers to start using StreamFund with minimal setup.
- **Stablecoin Donations**: Supports popular stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI) and ETH, providing a stable and accessible means for viewers to donate.
